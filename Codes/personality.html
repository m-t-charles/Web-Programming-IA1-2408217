<img src="Assets/wonderwoman.jpg" alt="Wonder Woman image not found sorry">
</div>
<div class="hero-text">
<blockquote>
"Because no matter how small an act of kindness or generosity or simple positivity you put out in the world, it will make a difference."
</blockquote>
<p>Wonder Woman is my hero due to her being the first female superhero that started out as good and then went on to lead with compassion and respect. She originated as a symbol of hope for women whose husbands were out at war. </p>
<p>What inspires me is her why to always find a different and often more compassionate approach to her problems. The way she's an example that women around the can do just as much as their male counterparts.</p>

<h4>Admirable Qualities:</h4>

 <h3>AI Business Idea Report: Personalized Fitness and Nutrition Plans</h3>
<p>After reading through the AI Business Ideas of 2025 clog, the idea that stuck out to me was the AI-powered fitness app. It would use the AI systems to calculate what lifestyle would be best for the user to leave healthy.</p>
                
<h4>Application in My World</h4>
<p> As some struggling with chronic diseases themself, the app could greatly benefit me to learn how to live healthy with my condition. It would also help those who can't see a nutritionalist for numerous reasons.</p>
                
<h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
<p> A key ethical issue to consider is that it violates many laws for those unrelated to certain medical fields to see one's medical documents. Even wit giving permission, the databases being seen b anyone else would be a huge violation.</p>
                
<h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
<p>To address these concerns, I would ensure that the data for the users would stay encrypted with the actual database itself.</p>
                
<h4>Existing Example</h4>
<p>An existing app in this space is <a href="https://www.fitnessai.com" target="_blank">Fitness AI</a>, which uses adaptive technology to personalize fitness workouts and meals.</p>
