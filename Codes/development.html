 <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
 <p>This chapter aptly named achieve your goals covers two friends, Micheal and Charlie, speaking causally in a diner. Charlie then gives advice to Micheal to know his goals in life as it will help him feel accomplished in life. Having his goals as motivation would help him to not feel stuck in his career. His advice comes from his own hero Mr. Davis.</p>

<div class="personal-application">
<h4>Personal Application</h4>
<p> I, like Micheal, had no written down goals just knew that I wanted to do something. The advice given made me think what i really wanted to do and starting writing short term and long term goals. Such as what I wanted to do in university and where I wanted to work after it. </p>
